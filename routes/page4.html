    <h3>First some simple facts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vanilla webapps are simple and easy to understand.</li>
        <li>No need to learn a framework or build tools.</li>
        <li>
            No breaking updates because node version and/or npm packages not
            kompatible anymore, or have breaking changes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blazing fast udpates. I just change html content and
            <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>, boom ready.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other colleges, which are not programmers, can change content when I
            am not reachable.
        </li>
        <li>
            This webapp will work for long time, because it's just web
            standards.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My way to that point in short</h3>
    <p>
        I started at the early 2000er with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as hobbiest.
        But in 2010, I decided to study this kind of programming, so I did. This
        was the first time, I header about KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
    </p>
    <p>
        Years gone by, I started to work as a webdeveloper after the study and
        used jQuery alot, then the new hot thing react comes into town, so I did
        that. But with react, I had the first things that I realy hated. I had
        some components and had to share some state, which I did with redux. Oh
        man how I hated that crazy complex redux thing.<br />
        Searching for better solutions, some day I heard about sveltejs and YES
        yes yes! Their it is, a simple global immutable store variable, that can
        simple be set in every component like "a = 1". Wow, that was a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as svelte grows and becomes sveltekit and now svelte5 with runes and
        so on, it's again became more and more complex to write a simple webapp.
        I don't want to learn all that stuff, I just want to write a simple
        webapp, that works.<br />
        Another thing was, that I sometimes had to do some simple changes in an
        app, but npm update breaks everything. So how do I sell my client 2
        hours for just a simple wording change, thats not possible and even not
        fair. This annoys me a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        So my whish for an more simpler workflow, without complex build tools,
        grows more and more. That's why I created this webapp. If you
        interessted in this kind of uproach, you can follow me on
        <a href="https://github.com/mike-tuxedo">GitHub</a>. I have some similar
        projects there.

    <h3>But why not doing XY?</h3>

        <summary>Why not using a framework?</summary>
        <p>
            Vanilla webapps are simple and easy to understand. More complex apps
            may need a framework, but honestly, how many apps do you realy
            create the have that level of complexity to need a framework?
